AIESEC EXPA/OP Simulator
===================


This is a basic simulation of AIESEC's EXPA & OP v2, which I used to use for AIESEC in India's Induction Conferences. Features include opening forms on EXPA, registering people on OP, matching, and value delivery and score calculation.

Support
--------------------
The entirety of this application was written by me through the course of a conference pre-meeting, hence, the code is messy and uncommented. I am providing the code as-is. It is recommended that you have a developer experienced in PHP to understand how to set up the tables and modify the code, if required. I will not provide support on installation or bugfixing, as this code was never made to be released to the public.
